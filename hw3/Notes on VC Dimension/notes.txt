VC Dimension basically is equal to the effective number of parameters or the degrees
of freedom. dvc = d + 1, in case of Perceptrons in d-dimensional Euclieadean space
and then we use this to obtain the generalization bound which helps us track the out of sample error
without knowing the number of data points of the actual testing set. It is the
sum of in-sample error and omega, wherein omega depends on the number of data points
as well as the accuracy/sensitivity. As a rule of sum N>=10dvc.
VC dimension of a hypothesis is the maximum number of points it can shatter.
