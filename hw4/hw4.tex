\begin{abstract}
This document contains my attempt at the homework 4 problems of the course
Learning From Data ({\bf CS156}) as taught by {\em Yaser Abu-Mostafa, Caltech}.
\end{abstract}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[$\bullet$] {\bf Generalization Error}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \subitem {\small 1.[d], Using the VC-Bound Inequality the answer can be obtained}
        \subitem {\small 2.[d], Devryoe's bound is the tighest, by graphing the functions it can be checked}
        \subitem {\small 3.[c], Parrondo and Van den Broek's bound is the tighest, by graphing the functions it can be checked}
    \end{enumerate}

\item[$\bullet$] {\bf Bits and Variance}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \subitem {\small 4.[e], $\overline{g(x)}$=$2.50x$, simulation done t9hrough python}
        \subitem {\small 5.[b], Variance is defined as $(\overline{g(x)}$-$f(x))^2$, wherein $f(x)$ is the target function, since the derivative of $sin(\pi x)$is approximately $3$ and hence the sqaure of the difference comes out to be close to 0.3}
        \subitem {\small 6.[a], variance is defined as deviation of any hypothesis from the approximate function, since almost all the hypothesis that are generated are centered around $g(x)}$ hence the answer is close to $0.1$}
        \subitem {\small 7.[b], modified simulation with these fucntions gives us the answer that original hypothesis gives the least out-of sample error}
    \end{enumerate}


\item[$\bullet$] {\bf VC Dimension}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \subitem {\small 8.[c], $q+1$ is the breakpoint, hence q is the VC Dimension}
        \subitem {\small 9.[b]}
        \subitem {\small 10.[d]}
    \end{enumerate}


\end{enumerate}
